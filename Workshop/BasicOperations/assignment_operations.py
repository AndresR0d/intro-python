Assignment Operators:

= (Assignment): Assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left.
+= (Add and Assign): Adds the value on the right to the variable 
    and assigns the result to the variable.
-= (Subtract and Assign): Subtracts the value on the right from the variable
   and assigns the result to the variable.
*= (Multiply and Assign): Multiplies the variable by the value on the right
    and assigns the result to the variable.
/= (Divide and Assign): Divides the variable by the value on the right
    and assigns the result to the variable.
//= (Floor Divide and Assign): Performs floor division on the variable
    and assigns the result.
%= (Modulus and Assign): Computes the modulus of the variable
    and assigns the result.
**= (Exponentiate and Assign): Raises the variable to the power of the value
    on the right and assigns the result.
