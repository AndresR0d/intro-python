"""
Comperason Operators:
== (Equal): Tests if two values are equal.
!= (Not Equal): Tests if two values are not equal.
< (Less Than): Tests if the left value is less than the right value.
> (Greater Than): Tests if the left value is greater than the right value.
<= (Less Than or Equal To): Tests if the left value is less than or equal to
    the right value.
>= (Greater Than or Equal To): Tests if the left value is greater than or
    equal to the right value.

Note: Comperason Operators will always return a Boolean value (True or False)
