"""
Arithmetic Operators:
+ (Addition): Adds two numbers.
- (Subtraction): Subtracts the right operand from the left operand.
* (Multiplication): Multiplies two numbers.
/ (Division): Divides the left operand by the right operand (result is a float)
// (Floor Division): Divides the left operand by the right operand
    and returns the largest integer not greater than the result.
% (Modulus): Returns the remainder of the division of the left operand
    by the right operand.
** (Exponentiation): Raises the left operand to the power of the right operand.
